# webdev-coding-quiz

## Description
This is a short, timed quiz with questions regarding topics a junior web developer should be familiar with. The user is given 50 seconds
For every question answered correctly, the user is awarded 10 points, which is added to their score.
For every wrong answer, 10 seconds is subtracted from the clock.
Once the quiz is over, any remaining time on the clock is added to the user's score, and then saved to local storage, along with a name.

## Unfortunately, due to time constraints, a few things do not work properly: 

- High scores are saved as '0', no matter the result
- High Scores past the first score are stored as 'undefined undefined'

I would like to revisit this project, to fix these errors, and make this a fully realized quiz app.

## Usage
See the deployed site: https://conscorn.github.io/webdev-coding-quiz/
Clone the repository: https://github.com/ConScorn/webdev-coding-quiz
